## Notes

- clone of MacBook Pro 16 design wise, marginally heavier, slightly thicker
- poor tinny speakers compared to MacBook
- Windows front firing speaker mixer bug
- feature-full BIOS
- NVMe set in RAID mode on the controller by default for all modern Dells regardless of by number of m2 slots
  - [Intel Rapid Storage Technology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Rapid_Storage_Technology)
  - aka [FakeRAID](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RAID#Implementation)
  - requires `vmd` kernel module
  - `vmd` can cause [high power usage](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dell_XPS_13_Plus_(9320)#Cannot_enter_S0ix_causing_high_power_usage>)
  - [switching from RAID to AHCI](https://gist.github.com/chenxiaolong/4beec93c464639a19ad82eeccc828c63#switching-from-raid-to-ahci)
- everything working out of the box in Linux (including touchscreen, rotation, fingerprint) except the front firing speakers (fixed in next kernel release)
- can set custom charge limit in BIOS
- canâ€™t disable dGPU in BIOS
- Windows defaults to 2.5x scaling
- portability and tablet mode hampered by the size and weight
- touchpad mylar layer prevents capacitive grounding "vibration"
- both USB C ports are on the same side - minor annoyance depending on desk set up
- shame active stylus not included
- quieter fan than Framework
